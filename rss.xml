    <description>FsBlog aims to be a blog-aware static site generator, mostly built in F#. But don't worry, you won't even need to know any F# to get up and running. So long as you are comfortable using a command line or terminal, and have a degree of familiarity with Markdown and Razor syntax - you're good to go!
